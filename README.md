**This RavenDB data source plugin allows you to query and visualize your RavenDB data in Grafana**.

For monitoring metrics of a RavenDB instance (not its data) use the RavenDB Telegraf plugin.  
Please refer to: [Monitoring RavenDB Metrics](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/latest/http/server/administration/monitoring).

All query examples bellow are based on RavenDB's [sample data](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/latest/csharp/studio/database/tasks/create-sample-data).

# Querying Features
* **RQL**  
  From Grafana, query your RavenDB collections/indexes with [RQL - Raven Query Language](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/latest/csharp/indexes/querying/what-is-rql)


* **Visualizations**  
  The queried data can be presented in any of Grafana's tables & charts visualizations,   
  including Table data, Time series data & Spatial data.


* **Grafana Variables**  
  Querying with Grafana variables and templates is supported by the RavenDB plugin.


* **Examples**  
  [A simple collecton query](#a-simple-collection-query)  
  [Generate values for a Grafana variable](#generate-values-for-a-grafana-variable)  
  [Reference Grafana variable in a query](#reference-grafana-variable-in-a-query)  
  [Project query results as Time Series data](#project-query-results-as-time-series-data)  
  [Project query results as Spatial data](#project-query-results-as-spatial-data)  
  [Using Time Macro variables in a time series query](#using-time-macro-variables-in-a-time-series-query)  
  [Querying with Multi-Value variables](#querying-with-multi-value-variables)

### A simple collection query
Query for data from the 'Employees' collection:
```
from 'Employees' select LastName, FirstName, Title, Address
```

### Generate values for a Grafana variable
A RavenDB query can be used to populate a Grafana variable of Type: Query.  
Only the first column from the results is used.  
Therefore, use a query which returns a single column, e.g. Name here below.  
The Name results will populate the Grafana variable values.
```
from 'Products' select distinct Name 
```

![DefineQueryVariable](https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb-grafana-datasource/img/defineQueryVariable.png)

### Reference Grafana variable in a query
Once the Grafana variable is defined, it can be used within the RQL query.  
The following RQL queries a RavenDB index, results are filtered using the `Product` variable.
```
from index 'Product/Rating'
where Name = "${Product}"
select Rating
```

### Project query results as Time Series data
Alias a Date field (e.g. OrderedAt) with `Time`.  
Grafana will autodetect this as a time column and the results can be viewed in the time series chart.
```
from 'Orders'
select Freight, OrderedAt as Time
```

### Project query results as Spatial data
Alias a GeoData field (e.g. Address.Location.Latitude) with `Latitude`/`Longitude`.  
The results can then be viewed in the Geomap Panel.
```
from 'Suppliers'
where Address.Location != null
select 
   Name,
   Address.Location.Latitude as Latitude,
   Address.Location.Longitude as Longitude
```

### Using Time Macro variables in a time series query
| Grafana Variable | Description                                                                          | Example                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `$timeFilter`    | Will be replaced by the date range selected in Grafana's time selector               | "2021-11-17T16:56:28.158Z" and "2022-02-17T09:45:12.697Z" |
| `$__interval`    | Will be replaced by the interval suggested by Grafana (Time range / max data points) | 5m, 15s, etc.                                             |
```
from 'Products'
where id() == 'products/77-A'
select timeseries(
   from 'INC:Views'
   between $timeFilter
   group by $__interval
   select sum()
)
```

### Querying with Multi-Value variables
In order to properly use a multi-value variable in your query, format it using `doublequote`.  
The following RQL:
```
from 'Employees'
where FirstName in (${paramName:doublequote})
```
Will be translated to:
```
from 'Employees'
where FirstName in ("Peter", "Anna", "John")
```
